## What it does

Set up your bot by putting regular orders in your configuration file:

```json
{
    "orders": 
    [
        {
            "pair": "BTCBUSD",
            "quantity": 10,
            "frequency": "* * * * *",
            "exchange": "binance"
        },
        {
            "pair": "ETHBUSD",
            "quantity": 5,
            "frequency": "* 2 * * SUN",
            "exchange": "binance"
        }
    ]
}
```

Here, the first order should open a spot order for 10 (quantity) BUSD of BTC (pair) on Binance (exchange), every minute (cron frequency). The second order should open a spot order for 5 BUSD of ETH on Binance, every sunday at 2:00 (time set up in your docker).

You are responsible for filling up your account with the money you want to use with these periodic orders.

## How to Run It

3. Create a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`
4. Fill up your API Keys (to do: put helper links)
5. Create a json file for setting up your orders, specify the name of that json file in your `.env`. The json file must be in the root of the repository.
